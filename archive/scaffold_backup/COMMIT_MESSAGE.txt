chore(project): scaffold repo for clean commit

- Add project scaffold: `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`.
- Create `notebooks/` and `docs/` directories and copy active notebooks.
- Replace root `docsis_dashboard.py` with a safe launcher delegating to `src/dashboard/docsis_dashboard.py`.
- Preserve originals in `archive/` and keep core logic importable in `src/`.

Notes:
- Run `python -m streamlit run src/dashboard/docsis_dashboard.py` to launch the dashboard.
- Heavy tasks (SHAP, full retrain) are opt-in; use `--no-shap` for quick smoke runs.
